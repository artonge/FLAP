# FLAP - host your data

Welcome to the **FLAP** main repository. FLAP main goal is to ease self-hosted services administration to allow more people to manage their numeric data.

If you need help setting up services, take a look at [our commercial offers](https://www.flap.cloud).

### FLAP is:

-   A **framework for self-hosted services** administration.
-   An opinionated **selection of self-hosted services**.
-   A **nice web GUI** to access the services and manage users and domain names.

Once installed, most of the heavy lifting is done by the [`flapctl` CLI tool](https://gitlab.com/flap-box/flap/-/tree/master/system/cli).
