## External storages configuration
# Funkwhale can store uploaded files on Amazon S3 and S3-compatible storages (such as Minio)
# Uncomment and fill the variables below

# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
# AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=
# An optional bucket subdirectory were you want to store the files. This is especially useful
# if you plan to use share the bucket with other services
# AWS_LOCATION=

# If you use a S3-compatible storage such as minio, set the following variable
# the full URL to the storage server. Example:
#   AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://minio.mydomain.com
# AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=

# If you want to serve media directly from your S3 bucket rather than through a proxy,
# set this to true
# PROXY_MEDIA=false

# If you are using Amazon S3 to serve media directly, you will need to specify your region
# name in order to access files. Example:
#   AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=eu-west-2
# AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=

# If you are using Amazon S3, use this setting to configure how long generated URLs should stay
# valid. The default value is 3600 (60 minutes). The maximum accepted value is 604800 (7 days)

# AWS_QUERYSTRING_EXPIRE=
